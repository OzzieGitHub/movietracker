This program is a basic movie database that will allow a user to create lists of movies (and their details) for use by the user (list of movies in personal library, want to watch list, tracking watch history, etc.).

# Motivation
I've always wanted to keep a detailed database of the movies I currently own and the movies I want to watch in the future. This 
is the first non-school related and non-tutorial program that I've decided to undertake since I feel it is well within my current 
programming skill to complete, but it also leaves a lot of room for me to expand and refine as I continue increase my programming 
knowledge and level up my skills.
